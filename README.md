Film Development Timer/Controller/Helper

The project has been built to help me in developing 35mm films. This process requires strictly following timeline depending on used chemicals and film recomendations.

It supports four stages (this is set for Ilford Delta 100 / Ilfosol-3 / Ilfostop Stop Bath / Rapid Fixer)

* Development

Inirial agitation during first 10 sec - invert tank 4 times. Next repeat this on beginning of every next minute. Total development time is 7:30

Drain off developer 10 sec before end

* Stop bath

I use 2 min stop bath with 4 tank inversions at the beginning and after 1 min

* Fix

This is 4 min process - agitation is the same as in development.

* Rinse

This is three step process - fill with water, invert tank 5 timex / replace water, invert 10 times / replace water, invert 20 times
